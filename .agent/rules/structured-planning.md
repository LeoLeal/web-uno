"Think Step-by-Step" Pattern: Before answering, demand:

- Analyze: Break down the request, specifically listing all constraints (e.g., "Do not," "Only use").
- Plan: Outline the steps to fulfill the request.
- Execute: Provide the answer.
- Validate: Review the answer against the constraints in Step 1.
