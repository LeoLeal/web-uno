# Render Blueprint — Signaling Server
#
# Deploy: Connect this repo on https://dashboard.render.com/blueprints
#         Render will auto-detect this file and create the service.
#
# Keepalive: Render free tier spins down after 15 min idle.
#            Set up a cron ping to prevent this:
#            1. Go to https://cron-job.org (free) or UptimeRobot
#            2. Create a job that hits GET https://<your-service>.onrender.com/health
#            3. Set interval to every 14 minutes
#
# Client config: Set VITE_SIGNALING_URL=wss://<your-service>.onrender.com
#                in your SPA's environment (Render provides TLS automatically).
