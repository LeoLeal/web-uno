# Refactoring Change - No Spec Changes

This change is a pure code refactoring. No capabilities are added, modified, or removed.

**Proposal reference:** The proposal explicitly states:

- New Capabilities: None
- Modified Capabilities: None

The existing UI component specs (`ui-toggle-switch`, `ui-modal`, `ui-pill-button-group`, `ui-info-tooltip`) remain unchanged. Only the CSS implementation architecture changes, not the requirements.
