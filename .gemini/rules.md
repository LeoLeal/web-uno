# Project Rules

## Always Read AGENTS.md First

At the start of every conversation or when beginning work on this project, you MUST read `/AGENTS.md` before making any code changes, commits, or significant actions. This file contains important information on how to behave and write code for this project and Agent-specific instructions.

**Never skip this step.**
